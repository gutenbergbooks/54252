<h2>THE TOWN AND CASTLE OF LEIXLIP, COUNTY OF KILDARE.</h2>

<p>Localities are no less subject to the capricious mutations
of fashion in taste, than dress, music, or any other of the
various objects on which it displays its extravagant vagaries.
The place which on account of its beauties is at one period
the chosen resort of pleased and admiring crowds, at another
becomes abandoned and unthought of, as if it were an unsightly
desert, unfit for the enjoyment or happiness of civilized
man. Some other locality, perhaps of less natural or
acquired beauty, becomes the fashion of the day, and after a
time gets out of favour in turn, and is neglected for some
other novel scene before unthought of or disregarded. Yet
the principles of true taste are immutable, and that which is
really beautiful is not the less so because it has ceased to attract
the multitude, who are generally governed to a far greater
extent by accidental associations of ideas than by any abstract
feelings of the mind.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is less attributable to any characteristic volatility
in the character of the inhabitants of our metropolis,
than to the singular variety and number of the beautiful
localities which surround our city, and in emulous rivalry attract
our attention, that this inconstancy of attachment to
any one locality is more strikingly instanced among ourselves,
than among the citizens of any other great town with which
we are acquainted. But, however this may be, the fact is
unquestionable, that there is scarcely a spot of any natural or
improved beauty, within a few miles of us, which has not in
turn had its day of fashion, and its subsequent period of unmerited
neglect. Clontarf, with its sequestered green lanes,
and its glorious views of the bay&mdash;Glasnevin, the classical
abode of Addison, Parnell, Tickell, Sheridan, and Delany&mdash;Finglas,
with its rural sports&mdash;Chapelizod, the residence
of the younger Cromwell&mdash;Lucan, Leixlip, with their once
celebrated spas, and all the delightful epic scenery of the
Liffey&mdash;Dundrum, with its healthy mountain walks and atmosphere,
and many others unnecessary to mention, all experiencing
the effects of this inconstancy of fashion, have found
their once admired beauties totally disregarded, and the admiration
of the multitude almost wholly transferred to a wild
and unadorned beauty on the rocky shores of Kingstown and
Bullock, which our forefathers deemed unworthy of notice.
But let that beauty take warning from the fate of her predecessors,
and not hold her head too high in her day of triumph,
for she too will assuredly be cast off in turn, and find
herself neglected for some rival as yet unnoticed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Of such unmerited inconstancy and neglect there are no
localities in the neighbourhood of Dublin which have greater
reason to complain than the village of Lucan and that which
forms the subject of our prefixed embellishment. As the
establishment of peace in Ireland led to an increase of civilization,
which exhibited itself in improved roads and vehicles
of conveyance, and the citizens, emerging from their embattled
strongholds, ventured to enjoy the pleasures of nature and
rural life, Lucan and Leixlip, with the beautiful scenery in
which they are situated, became the favourite places of resort;
and their various natural attractions becoming heightened
by art, were described by travellers, and chaunted in
song. About “sixty years since” they had reached their
greatest glory, and Leixlip was the favourite of the day. It
is thus described at this period by the celebrated Doctor
Campbell:&mdash;“All the outlets of Dublin are pleasant, but
this is superlatively so which leads through Leixlip, a neat
little village about seven miles from Dublin, up the Liffey;
whose banks being prettily tufted with wood, and enlivened
by gentlemen’s seats, afford a variety of landscapes, beautiful
beyond description.” It was at this period also that O’Keefe,
in his popular opera of “The Poor Soldier,” makes Patrick
sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Though Leixlip is proud of its close shady bowers,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Its clear falling waters and murmuring cascades,</div>
<div class="verse">Its groves of fine myrtle, its beds of sweet flowers,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Its lads so well dressed, and its neat pretty maids.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But though Leixlip no longer holds out attractions sufficient
to gratify those whose tastes are dependent on fashion, it has
never ceased to be a favourite with all whose tastes had a
more solid foundation. It was here, and in its immediate
vicinity, that the two Robertses, genuine Irish landscape
painters, found many of the most congenial subjects for their
pencils. It was here, too, that the strong-headed painter of
strong heads&mdash;the Rembrandt of miniature painters, John
Comerford&mdash;used occasionally to retire, abandoning for a week
or two the intellectual society of Dublin which he so much
enjoyed, and the acquisition of gain which he no less relished,
to make some elaborate study of one of the scenes about
the Bridge of Leixlip, which he, in his own dogmatic way,
asserted, “for genuine landscape beauty, could not be surpassed
or even rivalled any where!” This estimate of the
beauties of Leixlip’s “close shady bowers, &amp;c.” was, we confess,
a somewhat extravagant one; yet, like most other honestly
formed opinions of Comerford’s, it would not have been
an easy task to shake his belief in its truth, and to sustain it he
could, if combated, adduce the testimony of his and our friend
Gaspar Gabrielli, the first of Italian landscape painters of our
times, who notwithstanding his pride in being a Roman, and his
national predilections in favour of the classic scenery of his
dear Italy, has often declared in our hearing that he had never
seen in his own country scenery of its kind comparable with
that of the Liffey, in the vicinity of Lucan and Leixlip.</p>

<p>But enthusiastic admiration of the scenery of Leixlip has
not been confined to the painters. Hear with what gusto our
friend C. O. lets himself out on this subject, not in his drawing-room
character as the clerical Connaught tourist, but
in his more natural, buoyant, and Irish one, as Terence
O’Toole, our co-labourer in the first volume of the <cite>Dublin
Penny Journal</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Any one passing over the Bridge of Leixlip, must, if his
eye is worth a farthing for anything else than helping him to
pick his way through the puddle, look up and down with delight
while moving over this bridge. To the right, the river
winning its noisy turbulent way over its rocky bed, and losing
itself afar down amidst embossing woods; to the left,
after plunging over the Salmon-leap, whose roar is heard
though half a mile off, and forming a junction with the Rye-water,
it takes a bend to the east, and washes the rich amphitheatre
with which Leixlip is environed. I question much
whether any castle, even Warwick itself [bravo, Terence!]
stands in a grander position than Leixlip Castle, as it embattles
the high and wooded grounds that form the forks of the
two rivers. Of the towers, the round one of course was
built by King John, the opposite square one by the Geraldines.
This noble and grandly circumstanced pile has been
in latter days the baronial residence of the White family, and
subsequently the residence of [lord-lieutenants] generals and
prelates. Here Primate Stone, more a politician than a
Christian [churchman], retired from his contest with the
Ponsonbys and the Boyles to play at cricket with General
Cunningham; here resided Speaker Connolly before he built
his splendid mansion at Castletown; here the <em>great</em> commoner,
as he was called, Tom Connolly, was born. Like many such
edifices, this castle is haunted: character and keeping would
be altogether lost if towers of 600 years’ standing, with rich
mullioned ‘windows that exclude the light, and passages that
lead to nothing,’ with tapestried chambers that have witnessed
pranks of revelry and feats of war, of Norman, Cromwellian,
and Williamite possession, if such a place had not its legend;
and one of Ireland’s wildest geniuses, the eccentric and splendid
Maturin, has decorated the subject with the colourings of
his vivid fancy.”</p>

<p>Terence adds:&mdash;“Leixlip is memorable in an historic point
of view as the place where, in the war commencing 1641, General
Preston halted when on his way to form a junction with
the Marquis of Ormonde to oppose the Parliamentarians.
Acknowledging that his army was not excommunication proof,
he bowed before the fiat of the Nuncio, and lost the best opportunity
that ever offered of saving his cause and his country
from what has been called the ‘curse of Cromwell.’”</p>

<p>To this brief but graphic sketch of our friend we can add
but little. Leixlip is a market and post town of the county of
Kildare, situated in the barony of North <em>Salt</em>&mdash;a name derived
from the Latin appellation of the cataract called the
<i>Saltus Salmonis</i>, “Salmon Leap,” in the vicinity of the town&mdash;and
is about eight miles from Dublin. It contains between eleven
and twelve hundred inhabitants, and consists of one long
street of houses, well, though irregularly built, but exhibiting
for the greater number an appearance of negligence and decay.
It is bounded on one extremity by the river Liffey,
which is crossed by a bridge of ancient construction, and on
the other by the Rye-water, over which there is a bridge of
modern date. As the focus of a parish, it has a church and a
Roman Catholic chapel, both of ample size and substantial
construction, but, like most edifices of their class in Ireland,
but little remarkable for the purity of their architectural
styles. The latter is of recent erection. Its most imposing
architectural feature is, however, its castle, which is
magnificently situated on a steep and richly wooded bank over
the Liffey; but though of great antiquity, it exhibits in its
external character but little of the appearance of an ancient
fortress, having been modernised by the Hon. George Cavendish,
its present occupier. On its west side it is flanked by a
circular, and on its east by a square tower. This castle is
supposed to have been erected in the reign of Henry II. by
Adam de Hereford, one of the chief followers of Earl Strongbow,
from whom he received as a gift the tenement of the
Salmon Leap, and other extensive possessions. It is said to
have been the occasional residence of Prince John during his
governorship of Ireland in the reign of his father; and in recent
times it was a favourite retreat of several of the Viceroys,
one of whom, Lord Townsend, usually spent the summer here.
From an inquisition taken in 1604, it appears that the manor
of Leixlip was part of the possessions of the abbey of St Thomas
in Dublin. In 1668, the castle, with sixty acres of land,
belonged to the Earl of Kildare. They afterwards passed
into the hands of the Right Hon. Thomas Connolly, Speaker
of the Irish House of Commons, and are now the property of
Colonel Connolly of Castletown.</p>

Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Dublin, speaks of it as “a military
game that engages the mental faculties, like mathematical science.” O’Flaherty’s
Ogygia states that Cathir, the 120th king of Ireland, left among his
bequests to Crimthan “two chess-boards with their chess-men distinguished
with their specks and power; on which account he was constituted master
of the games in Leinster.”</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Discretion.</span>&mdash;This is a nice perception of what is right
and proper under the circumstances in which a person is
called to act. It may be illustrated by the <em>feelers</em> of the cat,
which are long hairs placed upon her nose, with which she
readily measures the space between sticks and stones through
which she desires to pass, and thus determines, by a delicate
touch, whether it is sufficiently large to let her go through
without being scratched. Thus discretion appreciates difficulties,
dangers, and obstructions around, and enables a person
to decide upon the proper course of action. “There are
many more shining qualities in the mind of man, but there is
none so useful as discretion. It is this which gives a value to
all the rest, which sets them at work, and turns them to the
advantage of the person who is possessed of them. Without
it, learning is pedantry and wit impertinence; nay, virtue
itself often looks like weakness. Discretion not only shows
itself in words, but in all the circumstances of action; and is
like an agent of Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary
chances of life.” But how shall discretion be cultivated
in children? Chiefly by example. It is a virtue especially
committed to the cultivation of the mother. She may do
much to promote it, by rebuking acts of imprudence, and bestowing
due encouragement upon acts of discretion. Let the
mother remember that discretion is important to men, and
see that she cherishes it in her sons; let her remember that it
is essential to women, and make sure of it in her daughters.&mdash;<cite>Dr
Channing.</cite></p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE IRISH MATCHMAKER.<br />
<span class="smaller">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</span></h2>

<p>Though this word at a glance may be said to explain itself,
yet lest our English or Scotch readers might not clearly understand
its meaning, we shall briefly give them such a definition
of it as will enable them to comprehend it in its full extent.
The Irish Matchmaker, then, is a person selected to conduct
reciprocity treaties of the heart between lovers themselves in
the first instance, or, where the principal parties are indifferent,
between their respective families, when the latter happen
to be of opinion that it is a safer and more prudent thing to
consult the interest of the young folk rather than their inclination.
In short, the Matchmaker is the person engaged in
carrying from one party to another all the messages, letters,
tokens, presents, and secret communications of the tender passion,
in whatever shape or character the said parties may deem
it proper to transmit them. The Matchmaker, therefore, is
a general negociator in all such matters of love or interest as
are designed by the principals or their friends to terminate in
the honourable bond of marriage; for with nothing morally
improper or licentious, or approaching to the character of an
intrigue, will the regular Irish Matchmaker have any thing at
all to do. The Matchmaker, therefore, after all, is only the
creature of necessity, and is never engaged by an Irishman
unless to remove such preliminary obstacles as may stand in
the way of his own direct operations. In point of fact, the
Matchmaker is nothing but a pioneer, who, after the plan of
the attack has been laid down, clears away some of the rougher
difficulties, until the regular advance is made, the siege opened
in due form, and the citadel successfully entered by the principal
party.</p>

<p>We have said thus much to prevent our fair neighbours of
England and Scotland from imagining that because such a
character as the Irish Matchmaker exists at all, Irishmen are
personally deficient in that fluent energy which is so necessary
to express the emotions of the tender passion. Addison has
proved to the satisfaction of any rational mind that modesty
and assurance are inseparable&mdash;that a blushing face may accompany
a courageous, nay, a desperate heart&mdash;and that, on
the contrary, an abundance of assurance may be associated
with a very handsome degree of modesty. In love matters, I
grant, modesty is the <i lang="it">forte</i> of an Irishman, whose character in
this respect has been unconsciously hit off by the poet. Indeed
he may truly be termed <i lang="la">vultus ingenui puer, ingenuique pudoris</i>;
which means, when translated, that in looking for a wife an
Irishman is “a <em>boy</em> of an <em>easy</em> face, and remarkable modesty.”</p>

<p>At the head of the Matchmakers, and far above all competitors,
stands the Irish Midwife, of whose abilities in this way
it is impossible to speak too highly. And let not our readers
imagine that the duties which devolve upon her, as well as
upon matchmakers in general, are slight or easily discharged.
To conduct a matter of this kind ably, great tact, knowledge
of character, and very delicate handling, are necessary. To
be incorruptible, faithful to both parties, not to give offence
to either, and to obviate detection in case of secret bias or partiality,
demand talents of no common order. The amount of
fortune is often to be regulated&mdash;the good qualities of the parties
placed in the best, or, what is often still more judicious,
in the most suitable light&mdash;and when there happens to be a
scarcity of the commodity, it must be furnished from her own
invention. The miser is to be softened, the contemptuous
tone of the purse-proud <i lang="ga">bodagh</i> lowered without offence, the
crafty cajoled, and sometimes the unsuspecting overreached.
Now, all this requires an able hand, as matchmaking in general
among the Irish does. Indeed I question whether the
wiliest politician that ever attempted to manage a treaty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
peace between two hostile powers could have a more difficult
card to play than often falls to the lot of the Irish Matchmaker.</p>

<p>The Midwife, however, from her confidential intercourse
with the sex, and the respect with which both young and old
of them look upon her, is peculiarly well qualified for the office.
She has seen the youth shoot up and ripen into the young man&mdash;she
has seen the young man merged into the husband, and
the husband very frequently lost in the wife. Now, the marks
and tokens by which she noted all this are as perceptible in
the young of this day as they were in the young of fifty
years ago; she consequently knows from experience how to
manage each party, so as to bring about the consummation
which she so devoutly wishes.</p>

<p>Upon second thoughts, however, we are inclined to think after
all that the right of precedence upon this point does not exclusively
belong to the Midwife; or at least, that there exists another
person who contests it with her so strongly that we are
scarcely capable of determining their respective claims: this
is the <em>Cosherer</em>. The Cosherer in Ireland is a woman who goes
from one relation’s house to another, from friend to friend,
from acquaintance to acquaintance&mdash;is always welcome, and
uniformly well treated. The very extent of her connexions
makes her independent; so that if she receives an affront,
otherwise a cold reception, from one, she never feels it to affect
her comfort, but on the contrary carries it about with her
in the shape of a complaint to the rest, and details it with
such a rich spirit of vituperative enjoyment, that we believe
in our soul some of her friends, knowing what healthful occupation
it gives her, actually affront her from pure kindness.
The Cosherer is the very impersonation of industry. Unless
when asleep, no mortal living ever saw her hands idle. Her
principal employment is knitting; and whether she sits, stands,
or walks, there she is with the end of the stocking under her
arm, knit, knit, knitting. She also sews and quilts; and
whenever a quilting is going forward, she can tell you at once
in what neighbour’s house the quilting-frame was used last,
and where it is now to be had; and when it has been got, she
is all bustle and business, ordering and commanding about
her&mdash;her large red three-cornered pincushion hanging conspicuously
at her side, a lump of chalk in one hand, and a coil of
twine in the other, ready to mark the pattern, whether it be
wave, square, or diamond.</p>

<p>The Cosherer is always dressed with neatness and comfort,
but generally wears something about her that reminds one of
a day gone by, and may be considered as the lingering remnant
of some old custom that has fallen into disuse. This,
slight as it is, endears her to many, for it stands out as the
memorial of some old and perhaps affecting associations, which
at its very appearance are called out from the heart in which
they were slumbering.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine a happier life than that of the
Cosherer. She has evidently no trouble, no care, no children,
nor any of the various claims of life, to disturb or encumber
her. Wherever she goes she is made, and finds herself, perfectly
at home. The whole business of her life is carrying
about intelligence, making and projecting matches, singing old
songs and telling old stories, which she frequently does with
a feeling and unction not often to be met with. She will sing
you the different sets and variations of the old airs, repeat the
history and traditions of old families, recite <i lang="ga">ranns</i>, interpret
dreams, give the origin of old local customs, and tell a ghost
story in a style that would make your hair stand on end. She
is a bit of a doctress, too&mdash;an extensive herbalist, and is very
skilful and lucky among children. In short, she is a perfect
Gentleman’s Magazine in her way&mdash;a regular repertory of
traditionary lore, a collector and distributor of social antiquities,
dealing in every thing that is timeworn or old, and handling
it with such a quiet and antique air, that one would imagine
her life to be a life not of years but of centuries, and
that she had passed the greater portion of it, long as it was,
in “wandering by the shores of old romance.”</p>

<p>Such a woman the reader will at once perceive is a formidable
competitor for popular confidence with the Midwife.
Indeed there is but one consideration alone upon which we
would be inclined to admit that the latter has any advantage
over her&mdash;and it is, that she <em>is the Midwife</em>; a word which is
a tower of strength to her, not only against all professional
opponents, but against such analogous characters as would
intrude even upon any of her subordinate or collateral offices.
As matchmakers, it is extremely difficult to decide between
her and the Cosherer; so much so, indeed, that we are disposed
to leave the claim for priority undetermined. In this
respect each pulls in the same harness; and as they are so well
matched, we will allow them to jog on side by side, drawing
the youngsters of the neighbouring villages slowly but surely
towards the land of matrimony.</p>

<p>In humble country life, as in high life, we find in nature the
same principles and motives of action. Let not the speculating
mother of rank, nor the husband-hunting dowager, imagine
for a moment that the plans, stratagems, lures, and trap-falls,
with which they endeavour to secure some wealthy fool
for their daughters, are not known and practised&mdash;ay, and
with as much subtlety and circumvention too&mdash;by the very
humblest of their own sex. In these matters they have not
one whit of superiority over the lowest, sharpest, and most
fraudulent gossip of a country village, where the arts of women
are almost as sagaciously practised, and the small scandal as
ably detailed, as in the highest circles of fashion.</p>

<p>The third great master of the art of matchmaking is the
<em>Shanahus</em>, who is nothing more or less than the counterpart of
the Cosherer; for as the Cosherer is never of the male sex, so
the Shanahus is never of the female. With respect to their
habits and modes of life, the only difference between them is,
that as the Cosherer is never idle, so the Shanahus never works;
and the latter is a far superior authority in old popular prophecy
and genealogy. As a matchmaker, however, the Shanahus
comes infinitely short of the Cosherer; for the truth is,
that this branch of diplomacy falls naturally within the manœuvring
and intriguing spirit of a woman.</p>

<p>Our readers are not to understand that in Ireland there
exists, like the fiddler or dancing-master, a distinct character
openly known by the appellation of matchmaker. No such
thing. On the contrary, the negotiations they undertake are
all performed under false colours. The business, in fact, is close
and secret, and always carried on with the profoundest mystery,
veiled by the sanction of some other ostensible occupation.</p>

<p>One of the best specimens of the kind we ever met was old
Rose Mohan, or, as she was called, Moan, a name, we doubt,
fearfully expressive of the consequences which too frequently
followed her own negociations. Rose was a tidy creature of
middle size, who always went dressed in a short crimson cloak
much faded, a striped red and blue drugget petticoat, and a
heather-coloured gown of the same fabric. When walking,
which she did with the aid of a light hazel staff hooked at the
top, she generally kept the hood of the cloak over her head,
which gave to her whole figure a picturesque effect; and when
she threw it back, one could not help admiring how well her
small but symmetrical features agreed with the dowd cap of
white linen, with a plain muslin border, which she wore. A
pair of blue stockings and sharp-pointed shoes high in the
heels completed her dress. Her features were good-natured
and Irish; but there lay over the whole countenance an expression
of quickness and sagacity, contracted no doubt by a
habitual exercise of penetration and circumspection. At the
time I saw her she was very old, and I believe had the reputation
of being the last in that part of the country who was
known to go about from house to house spinning on the distaff,
an instrument which has now passed away, being more
conveniently replaced by the spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>The manner and style of Rose’s visits were different from
those of any other who could come to a farmer’s house, or
even to an humble cottage, for to the inmates of both were
her services equally rendered. Let us suppose, for instance,
the whole female part of a farmer’s family assembled of a summer
evening about five o’clock, each engaged in some domestic
employment: in runs a lad who has been sporting about,
breathlessly exclaiming, whilst his eyes are lit up with delight,
“Mother! mother! here’s Rose Moan coming down the boreen!”
“Get out, avick; no, she’s not.” “Bad cess to me
but she is; that I may never stir if she isn’t! Now!” The
whole family are instantly at the door to see if it be she, with
the exception of the prettiest of them all, Kitty, who sits at
her wheel, and immediately begins to croon over an old Irish
air which is sadly out of tune; and well do we know, notwithstanding
the mellow tones of that sweet voice, why it is
so, and also why that youthful cheek in which health and
beauty meet, is now the colour of crimson.</p>

<p>“<i lang="ga">Oh, Rosha, acushla, cead millie failte ghud!</i> (Rose, darlin’,
a hundred thousand welcomes to you!) Och, musha, what
kep you away so long, Rose? Sure you won’t lave us this
month o’ Sundays, Rose?” are only a few of the cordial expressions
of hospitality and kindness with which she is received.
But Kitty, whose cheek but a moment ago was carmine, why
is it now pale as the lily?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>“An’ what news, Rose?” asks one of her sisters; “sure
you’ll tell us every thing; won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Throth, avillish, <em>I have no bad news</em>, any how&mdash;an’ as to
tellin’ you <em>all</em>&mdash;Biddy, <i lang="ga">lhig dumh</i>, let me alone. No, I have no
bad news, God be praised, <em>but good news</em>.”</p>

<p>Kitty’s cheek is again crimson, and her lips, ripe and red as
cherries, expand with the sweet soft smile of her country, exhibiting
a set of teeth for which many a countess would barter
thousands, and giving out a breath more delicious than the
fragrance of a summer meadow. Oh, no wonder, indeed, that
the kind heart of Rose contains in its recesses a message to
her as tender as ever was transmitted from man to woman!</p>

<p>“An’, Kitty, acushla, where’s the welcome from <em>you</em>, that’s
my favourite? Now don’t be jealous, childre; sure you all
know she is, an’ ever an’ always was.”</p>

<p>“If it’s not upon my lips, it’s in my heart, Rose, an’ from
that heart you’re welcome!”</p>

<p>She rises up and kisses Rose, who gives her one glance of
meaning, accompanied by the slightest imaginable smile, and
a gentle but significant pressure of the hand, which thrills to
her heart and diffuses a sense of ecstacy through her whole
spirit. Nothing now remains but the opportunity, which is
equally sought for by Rose and her, to hear without interruption
the purport of her lover’s communication; and this we
leave to lovers to imagine.</p>

<p>In Ireland, however odd it may seem, there occur among
the very poorest classes some of the hardest and most penurious
bargains in matchmaking that ever were heard of or
known. Now, strangers might imagine that all this close higgling
proceeds from a spirit naturally near and sordid, but it
is not so. The real secret of it lies in the poverty and necessity
of the parties, and chiefly in the bitter experience of their
parents, who, having come together in a state of destitution,
are anxious, each as much at the expense of the other as possible,
to prevent their children from experiencing the same
privation and misery which they themselves felt. Many a
time have matches been suspended or altogether broken off
because one party refuses to give his son a slip of a pig, or
another his daughter a pair of blankets; and it was no unusual
thing for a matchmaker to say, “Never mind; I have
it all settled <em>but the slip</em>.” One might naturally wonder why
those who are so shrewd and provident upon this subject do
not strive to prevent early marriages where the poverty is so
great. So unquestionably they ought, but it is a settled usage
of the country, and one too which Irishmen have never been
in the habit of considering as an evil. We have no doubt
that if they once began to reason upon it as such, they would
be very strongly disposed to check a custom which has been
the means of involving themselves and their unhappy offspring
in misery, penury, and not unfrequently in guilt itself.</p>

<p>Rose, like many others in this world who are not conscious
of the same failing, smelt strongly of the shop; in other words,
her conversation had a strong matrimonial tendency. No two
beings ever lived so decidedly antithetical to each other in this
point of view as the Matchmaker and the Keener. Mention
the name of an individual or a family to the Keener, and the
medium through which her memory passes back to them is
that of her professed employment&mdash;a mourner at wakes and
funerals.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know young Kelly of Tamlaght?”</p>

<p>“I do, avick,” replies the Keener, “and what about him?”</p>

<p>“Why, he was married to-day mornin’ to ould Jack M’Cluskey’s
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Well, God grant them luck an’ happiness, poor things!
I do indeed remember his father’s wake an’ funeral well&mdash;ould
Risthard Kelly of Tamlaght&mdash;a dacent corpse he made for
his years, an’ well he looked. But indeed I <em>knewn</em> by the
colour that sted in his checks, an’ the limbs remainin’ soople for
the twenty-four hours afther his departure, that some of the
family ’ud follow him afore the year was out: an’ so she did.
The youngest daughter, poor thing, by raison of a could she
got, over-heatin’ herself at a dance, was stretched beside him
that very day was eleven months; and God knows it was from
the heart my grief came for <em>her</em>&mdash;to see the poor handsome
colleen laid low so soon. But when a gallopin’ consumption
sets in, avourneen, sure we all know what’s to happen. In
Crockaniska churchyard they sleep&mdash;the Lord make both their
beds in heaven this day!” The very reverse of this, but at
the same time as inveterately professional, was Rose Moan.</p>

<p>“God save you, Rose.”</p>

<p>“God save you kindly, avick. Eh!&mdash;let me look at you.
Aren’t you red Billy M’Guirk’s son from Ballagh?”</p>

<p>“I am, Rose. An’, Rose, how is yourself an’ the world gettin’
an?”</p>

<p>“Can’t complain, dear, in such times. How are yez all at
home, alanna?”</p>

<p>“Faix, middlin’ well, Rose, thank God an’
you.&mdash;You heard of my granduncle’s death, big Ned M’Coul?”</p>

<p>“I did, avick, God rest him. Sure it’s well I remimber his
weddin’, poor man, by the same atoken that I know one that
helped him on wid it a thrifle. He was married in a blue coat
and buckskins, an’ wore a scarlet waistcoat that you’d see
three miles off. Oh, well I remimber it. An’ whin he was
settin’ out that mornin’ to the priest’s house, ‘Ned,’ says I,
an’ I fwhishspered him, ‘dhrop a button on the right knee
afore you get the words said.’ ‘<i lang="ga">Thighum</i>,’ said he, wid a
smile, an’ he slipped ten thirteens into my hand as he spoke.
‘I’ll do it,’ said he, ‘and thin a fig for the fairies!’&mdash;becase
you see if there’s a button of the right knee left unbuttoned,
the fairies&mdash;this day’s Friday, God stand betune us and harm!&mdash;can
do neither hurt nor harm to sowl or body, an’ sure that’s
a great blessin’, avick. He left two fine slips o’ girls behind
him.”</p>

<p>“He did so&mdash;as good-lookin’ girls as there’s in the parish.”</p>

<p>“Faix, an’ kind mother for them, avick. She’ll be marryin’
agin, I’m judgin’, she bein’ sich a fresh good-lookin’ woman.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s very likely, Rose.”</p>

<p>“Throth it’s natural, achora. What can a lone woman do
wid such a large farm upon her hands, widout having some
one to manage it for her, an’ prevint her from bein’ imposed
on? But indeed the first thing she ought to do is to marry off
her two girls widout loss of time, in regard that it’s hard to
say how a stepfather an’ thim might agree; and I’ve often
known the mother herself, when she had a fresh family comin’
an her, to be as unnatural to her fatherless childre as if she
was a stranger to thim, and that the same blood did’nt run in
their veins. Not saying that Mary M’Coul will or would act
that way by her own; for indeed she’s come of a kind ould
stock, an’ ought to have a good heart. Tell her, avick, when
you see her, that I’ll spind a day or two wid her&mdash;let me
see&mdash;to-morrow will be Palm Sunday&mdash;why, about the Aisther
holidays.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will, Rose, with great pleasure.”</p>

<p>“An’ fwhishsper, dear, jist tell her that I’ve a thing to say
to her&mdash;that I had a long dish o’ discoorse about her wid <em>a
friend o’ mine</em>. You wont forget now?”</p>

<p>“Oh the dickens a forget!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear: God mark you to grace, avourneen!
When you’re a little ouldher, maybe I’ll be a friend to you yet.”</p>

<p>This last intimation was given with a kind of mysterious
benevolence, very visible in the complacent shrewdness of her
face, and with a twinkle in the eye, full of grave humour and
considerable self-importance, leaving the mind of the person
she spoke to in such an agreeable uncertainty as rendered it
a matter of great difficulty to determine whether she was serious
or only in jest, but at all events throwing the onus of
inquiry upon him.</p>

<p>The ease and tact with which Rose could involve two young
persons of opposite sexes in a mutual attachment, were very
remarkable. In truth, she was a kind of matrimonial incendiary,
who went through the country holding her torch now
to this heart and again to that&mdash;first to one and then to another,
until she had the parish more or less in a flame. And
when we consider the combustible materials of which the Irish
heart is composed, it is no wonder indeed that the labour of
taking the census in Ireland increases at such a rapid rate
during the time that elapses between the periods of its being
made out. If Rose, for instance, met a young woman of her
acquaintance accidentally&mdash;and it was wonderful to think
how regularly these accidental meetings took place&mdash;she
would address her probably somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Arra, Biddy Sullivan, how are you, a-colleen?”</p>

<p>“Faix, bravely, thank you, Rose. How is yourself?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, thin, sorra bit o’ the health we can complain of,
Bhried, barrin’ whin this pain in the back comes upon us. The
last time I seen your mother, Biddy, she was complainin’ of a
<i lang="ga">weid</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I hope she’s betther, poor woman?”</p>

<p>“Hut! bad scran to the thing ails her! She has as light
a foot as e’er a one of us, an’ can dance ‘Jackson’s mornin’
brush’ as well as ever she could.”</p>

<p>“Throth, an’ I’m proud to hear it. Och! och! ‘Jackson’s
mornin’ brush!’ and it was she that <em>could</em> do it. Sure I remimber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
her wedding-day like yestherday. Ay, far an’ near
her fame wint as a dancer, an’ the clanest-made girl that ever
came from Lisbuie. Like yestherday do I remimber it, an’
how the squire himself an’ the ladies from the Big House came
down to see herself an’ your father, the bride and groom&mdash;an’
it wasn’t on every hill head you’d get sich a couple&mdash;dancin’
the same ‘Jackson’s mornin’ brush.’ Oh! it was far
and near her fame wint for dancin’ that.&mdash;An’ is there no news
wid you, Bhried, at all at all?”</p>

<p>“The sorra word, Rose: where ud I get news? Sure it’s
yourself that’s always on the fut that ought to have the news
for <em>us</em>, Rose alive.”</p>

<p>“An’ maybe I have too. I was spaikin’ to a friend o’ mine
about you the other day.”</p>

<p>“A friend o’ yours, Rose! Why, what friend could it be?”</p>

<p>“A friend o’ mine&mdash;ay, an’ of yours too. Maybe you have
more friends than you think, Biddy&mdash;and kind ones too, as far
as wishin’ you well goes, ’tany rate. Ay have you, faix, an’
friends that e’er a girl in the parish might be proud to hear
named in the one day wid her. Awouh!”</p>

<p>“Bedad we’re in luck, thin, for that’s more than I knew of.
An’ who may these great friends of ours be, Rose?”</p>

<p>“Awouh! Faix, as dacent a boy as ever broke bread the
same boy is, ‘and,’ says he, ‘if I had goold in bushelfuls, I’d think
it too little for that girl;’ but, poor lad, he’s not aisy or happy
in his mind in regard o’ that. ‘I’m afeard,’ says he, ‘that
she’d put scorn upon me, an’ not think me her aiquals. An’ no
more I am,’ says he again, ‘for where, afther all, would you
get the likes of Biddy Sullivan?’&mdash;Poor boy! throth my heart
aches for him!”</p>

<p>“Well, can’t you fall in love wid him yourself, Rose, whoever
he is?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, an’ if I was at your age, it would be no shame to
me to do so; but, to tell you the thruth, the sorra often ever
the likes of Paul Heffernan came acrass me.”</p>

<p>“Paul Heffernan! Why, Rose,” replied Biddy, smiling
with the assumed lightness of indifference, “is that your
beauty? If it is, why, keep him, an’ make much of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wurrah! the differ there is between the hearts an’
tongues of some people&mdash;one from another&mdash;an’ the way they
spaik behind others’ backs! Well, well, I’m sure that wasn’t
the way he spoke of you, Biddy; an’ God forgive you for runnin’
down the poor boy as you’re doin’. Trogs! I believe
you’re the only girl would do it.”</p>

<p>“Who, me! I’m not runnin’ him down. I’m neither runnin’
him up nor down. I have neither good nor bad to say about
him&mdash;the boy’s a black sthranger to me, barrin’ to know his
face.”</p>

<p>“Faix, an’ he’s in consate wid you these three months past,
an’ intinds to be at the dance on Friday next, in Jack
Gormly’s new house. Now, good bye, alanna; keep your
own counsel till the time comes, an’ mind what I said to you.
It’s not behind every ditch the likes of Paul Heffernan grows.
<i lang="ga">Bannaght lhath!</i> My blessin’ be wid you!”</p>

<p>Thus would Rose depart just at the critical moment, for
well she knew that by husbanding her information and leaving
the heart something to find out, she took the most effectual
steps to excite and sustain that kind of interest which is apt
ultimately to ripen, even from its own agitation, into the
attachment she is anxious to promote.</p>

<p>The next day, by a meeting similarly accidental, she comes
in contact with Paul Heffernan, who, honest lad, had never
probably bestowed a thought upon Biddy Sullivan in his life.</p>

<p>“<i lang="ga">Morrow ghud</i>, Paul!&mdash;how is your father’s son, ahager?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="ga">Morrow ghuteha</i>, Rose!&mdash;my father’s son wants nothin’
but a good wife, Rosha.”</p>

<p>“An’ it’s not every set day or bonfire night that a good
wife is to be had, Paul&mdash;that is, a <em>good</em> one, as you say; for,
throth, there’s many o’ them in the market sich as they are. I
was talkin’ about you to a friend of mine the other day&mdash;an’,
trogs, I’m afeard you’re not worth all the abuse we gave you.”</p>

<p>“More power to you, Rose! I’m oblaged to you. But who
is the friend in the manetime?”</p>

<p>“Poor girl! Throth, when your name slipped out an her, the
point of a rush would take a drop of blood out o’ her cheek,
the way she crimsoned up. ‘An’, Rose,’ says she, ‘if ever I
know you to breathe it to man or mortual, my lips I’ll never
open to you to my dyin’ day.’ Trogs, whin I looked at her,
an’ the tears standin’ in her purty black eyes, I thought I
didn’t see a betther favoured girl, for both face and figure,
this many a day, than the same Biddy Sullivan.”</p>

<p>“Biddy Sullivan! Is that long Jack’s daughter of Cargah?”</p>

<p>“The same. But, Paul, avick, if a syllable o’ what I tould
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hut, Rose! honour bright! Do you think me a <em>stag</em>,
that I’d go and inform on you?”</p>

<p>“Fwhishsper, Paul; she’ll be at the dance on Friday next
in Jack Gormly’s new house. So <i lang="ga">bannaght lhath</i>, an’ think
o’ what I betrayed to you.”</p>

<p>Thus did Rose very quietly and sagaciously bind two young
hearts together, who probably might otherwise have never for
a moment even thought of each other. Of course, when Paul
and Biddy met at the dance on the following Friday, the one
was the object of the closest attention to the other; and each
being prepared to witness strong proofs of attachment from
the opposite party, every thing fell out exactly according to
their expectations.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens that a booby of a fellow during his
calf love will employ a male friend to plead his suit with a
pretty girl, who, if the principal party had spunk, might be
very willing to marry him. To the credit of our fair countrywomen,
however, be it said, that in scarcely one instance out
of twenty does it happen, or has it ever happened, that any of
them ever fails to punish the faint heart by bestowing the fair
lady upon what is called the blackfoot or spokesman whom he
selects to make love for him. In such a case it is very naturally
supposed that the latter will speak two words for himself
and one for his friend, and indeed the result bears out the
supposition. Now, nothing on earth gratifies the heart of
the established Matchmaker so much as to hear of such a disaster
befalling a spoony. She exults over his misfortune for
months, and publishes his shame to the uttermost bounds of
her own little world, branding him as “a poor pitiful crature,
who had not the courage to spaik up for himself or to employ
them that could.” In fact, she entertains much the same feeling
against him that a regular physician would towards some
weak-minded patient, who prefers the knavish ignorance of a
quack to the skill and services of an able and educated medical
practitioner.</p>

<p>Characters like Rose are fast disappearing in Ireland; and
indeed in a country where the means of life were generally inadequate
to the wants of the population, they were calculated,
however warmly the heart may look back upon the memory
of their services, to do more harm than good, by inducing
young folks to enter into early and improvident marriages.
They certainly sprang up from a state of society not thoroughly
formed by proper education and knowledge&mdash;where
the language of a people, too, was in many extensive districts
in such a state of transition as in the interchange of affection
to render an interpreter absolutely necessary. We have ourselves
witnessed marriages where the husband and wife spoke
the one English and the other Irish, each being able with difficulty
to understand the other. In all such cases Rose was
invaluable. She spoke Irish and English fluently, and indeed
was acquainted with every thing in the slightest or most remote
degree necessary to the conduct of a love affair, from the
first glance up until the priest had pronounced the last words&mdash;or,
to speak more correctly, until “the throwing of the
stocking.”</p>

<p>Rose was invariably placed upon the <em>hob</em>, which is the seat
of comfort and honour at a farmer’s fireside, and there she
sat neat and tidy, detailing all the news of the parish, telling
them how such a marriage was one unbroken honeymoon&mdash;a
sure proof by the way that she herself had a hand in it&mdash;and
again, how another one did not turn out well, and she said so;
“there was always a bad dhrop in the Haggarties; but, my
dear, the girl herself was <em>for</em> him; so as she made her own bed
she must lie in it, poor thing. Any way, thanks be to goodness
I had nothing to do wid it!”</p>

<p>Rose was to be found in every fair and market, and always
at a particular place at a certain hour of the day, where the
parties engaged in a courtship were sure to meet her on these
occasions. She took a chirping glass, but never so as to become
unsteady. Great deference was paid to every thing she
said; and if this was not conceded to her, she extorted it with
a high hand. Nobody living could drink a health with half
the comic significance that Rose threw into her eye when saying,
“Well, young couple, here’s everything as you wish it!”</p>

<p>Rose’s motions from place to place were usually very slow,
and for the best reason in the world, because she was frequently
interrupted. For instance, if she met a young man
on her way, ten to one but he stood and held a long and earnest
conversation with her; and that it was both important
and confidential, might easily be gathered from the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
whenever a stranger passed, it was either suspended altogether,
or carried on in so low a tone as to be inaudible. This
held equally good with the girls. Many a time have I seen
them retracing their steps, and probably walking back a mile
or two, all the time engaged in discussing some topic evidently
of more than ordinary interest to themselves. And when they
shook hands and bade each other good bye, heavens! at what
a pace did the latter scamper homewards across fields and
ditches, in order to make up for the time she had lost!</p>

<p>Nobody ever saw Rose receive a penny of money, and yet
when she took a fancy, it was beyond any doubt that she has
often been known to assist young folks in their early struggles;
but in no instance was the slightest aid ever afforded to
any one whose union she had not herself been instrumental in
bringing about. As to the <em>when</em> and the <em>how</em> she got this
money, and the great quantity of female apparel which she was
known to possess, we think we see our readers smile at the
simplicity of those who may not be able to guess the several
sources from whence she obtained it.</p>

<p>One other fact we must mention before we close this sketch
of her character. There were <em>some</em> houses&mdash;we will not, for
we dare not, say <em>how many</em>&mdash;into which Rose was never seen
to enter. This, however, was not her fault. Every one knew
that what she did, she did always for the best; and if some
small bits of execration were occasionally levelled at her, it
was not more than the parties levelled at each other. All
marriages cannot be happy; and indeed it was a creditable
proof of Rose Moan’s sagacity that so few of those effected
through her instrumentality were unfortunate.</p>

<p>Poor Rose! matchmaking was the great business of your
simple but not absolutely harmless life. You are long since,
we trust, gone to that happy place where there are neither
marryings nor givings in marriage, but where you will have a
long Sabbath from your old habits and tendencies. We love
for more reasons than either one or two to think of your faded
crimson cloak, peaked shoes, hazel staff, clear grey eye, and
nose and chin that were so full of character. As you used to
say yourself, <i lang="ga">bannaght lhath!</i>&mdash;my blessing be with you!</p>

<h2 class="gap4">RANDOM SKETCHES.&mdash;No. I.</h2>

<h3>FELINE RECOLLECTIONS.</h3>

<p>One result of perusing such interesting papers on “the Intellectuality
of Domestic Animals” as that which lately appeared
in the <cite>Dublin University Magazine</cite>, should be the publication
of similar facts; another, the promotion of that kindness
towards the inferior creation which is still, alas! so sparingly
manifested. I therefore propose stuffing a cranny of
the <cite>Irish Penny Journal</cite> with a few particulars relating,
firstly, to the maternal and filial piety of the cat; secondly,
to the humanity (or, psychologically speaking, brutality) of
the same animal. Of the facts illustrative of the former virtues
I was an eye-witness&mdash;those illustrative of the latter I
had from a member of the family in which they occurred.</p>

<p>In my early home two cats, a mother and a son, formed
part of the establishment. The former, a dark-grey matron,
rejoiced in the euphonious name of <span class="smcap">Smut</span>&mdash;the colour of the
latter may be inferred from his appellation, <span class="smcap">Fox</span>. Smut was,
to be brief, the most lady-like cat I ever saw; Fox was a
huge Dan Donnelly of a brute, a very hero of the slates, and
the terror of all the cats in the neighbourhood, <em>save one</em>; he
walloped them right and left; and many a smirking sylph of
the gutters, wont to pick her steps daintily to avoid all possible
contact with the wet, was seen to scamper away screaming
when Fox appeared in view, for truth obliges me to record
that he spared neither age nor sex. Nor was he formidable
to the brute creation alone&mdash;humanity often suffered
under his visitations. There was no keener forager among
the larders and pantries of the neighbourhood. A poor dancing-master
who had a way of leaving his window open was
most frequently victimized; for as the said window was <em>convenient</em>
to the low roof of a back house, our hero used to
quietly walk in and purvey to his liking. In the recess of a
chimney, and several feet above the roof of our house, was a
kind of small platform, where Master Fox was usually pleased
to regale himself on his ill-gotten gains. One day I saw him
with a calf’s or lamb’s pluck in his mouth, twice as long as
himself, darting aloft towards his refectory. The weight of
the booty several times dragged him back; but he persevered
till he gained his point: it was a sight ludicrous beyond all
imagining.</p>

<p>But as it was not every day Master Fox could mulct the
circumambient dancing-master in a beef-steak or a calf’s pluck,
he often returned home hungry; and I am now come to the
point of proving the “intellectuality” of Madam Smut, as
evidenced in her maternal piety. Within the kitchen-door lay
a mat, in a hole in which she daily hid a portion of her lights.
She was generally dozing before the fire when her son came
in for the night, and whenever I happened to follow him and
watch her movements, she invariably looked up to see whether
he had scented the provender: and when satisfied on that
point, coiled herself up to sleep again. But her maternal
tenderness never interfered with her matronly dignity. Woe
betide Fox, if, in proceeding to take his place at the fire, he
attempted to pass between her and it. She would instantly
spring up and deal him a dab, which prevented for that time
a repetition of the indecorum. I have seen him steal most
cautiously along the forbidden path in the presumption that
she was asleep, but I do not remember to have ever seen him
effect a passage. I have said that he leathered all the cats
about him save one&mdash;that one was his mother. Determined
pugilist and fire-eater as he was, he never returned the dab
she gave him.</p>

<p>The fact of which I was only an ear-witness may be briefly
related. A lady of this city observing one day a wretched
kitten which had been ruthlessly flung into the street before
her residence, had it taken into the house and carefully tended.
Some time after, when it had grown into a thorough-bred
mouser, a strange cat with a broken leg hobbled into the yard,
where it was discovered by the foundling, which immediately
took charge of it, and regularly allotted to the sufferer a portion
of its own daily food till it was sufficiently recovered to
shift for itself.</p>

<p>As a warm friend of the inferior creation, I was much
pleased to find their cause pleaded towards the close of the
article, which gave rise to the present sketch, and a just encomium
passed on the author of “the Rights of Animals.”
And much was I gratified to find that the same cause appears
to maintain an abiding interest in the bosom of the first of
living poets. “C. O.” alludes as follows to a conversation he
had with Mr Wordsworth on the subject:&mdash;“I remember an
observation made to me by one of the most gifted of the human
race&mdash;one of the stars of this generation&mdash;the poet of nature
and of feeling&mdash;the good and the great Mr Wordsworth.
Having the honour of a conversation with him after he had
made a tour through Ireland, I in the course of it asked what was
the thing that most struck his observation here as making us
differ from the English; and he without hesitation said it was
the ill-treatment of our horses: that his soul was often, too
often, sick within him at the way in which he saw these creatures
of God abused.” One evening, which I had the happiness
of spending at Rydal Mount, the very same subject was
broached by Mr W. Defend my countrymen I could not,
but I parried the attack by showing that other segments of
the united kingdom had little right to boast over them in this
particular. This I proved by adverting to the notorious cat-skinning
of London&mdash;a horror unknown in Ireland, bad as we
are&mdash;and to certain atrocious cruelties which had just been
perpetrated on some horses in Sutherland (though I must confess
that I know too little of Scotland to pronounce whether
its national character is tarnished by cruelty to animals or
not). And much was I surprised when the son of the poet
threw discredit on the character of one of the first of London
newspapers, from which I had cited a recent case in proof of
my assertion. It was in 1833 I visited Rydal Mount. Should
this paper reach the eye of Mr W. jun., he may find my statement
corroborated, and the perpetration of the barbarous
trade demonstrated, by referring to the case of Elizabeth Rogerson,
an old offender, who in 1839 was condemned to the
ridiculously lenient penalty of two months’ imprisonment for
the crime, without hard labour. A diametrically opposite
opinion respecting the treatment of horses in Ireland was
once expressed to me by another English gentleman of some
celebrity in the religious world. He passed an encomium on
the kindness to animals observable in this country, from the
habit he had noticed among the drivers of jaunting-cars, during
his short stay in Dublin, of feeding their horses from their
hands with a wisp of hay at leisure moments&mdash;a pitch of humanity
just equivalent to that of greasing the wheels of their
vehicles.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
